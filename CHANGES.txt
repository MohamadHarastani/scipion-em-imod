3.1:
- fix wrong output file index numbers in the exclude views protocol
- fix gold erasing option in the fid. alignment protocol
- fix generating ctf output; hide some params from manual ctf protocol; do not run autofit for manual protocol
- added xform file to ctfphaseflip to rotate astigmatism estimation and adjust for x-shifts for the image center
- fix excluded views parsing from com files
- rename "normalization" to "preprocess" protocols
- handle excluded views properly (closes #137 , closes #147)
- ctfplotter handles excluded views properly, output ctfs for such views have 0 values

- pep8 fixes, add pip-related files
- mtffilter was missing pixelsize param, causing wrong filter being applied (always with 1A/px)
- add antialias param to ts norm protocol
- fix wrong default naming style for etomo
- enable robust fitting for beadtracker
- remove redundant updateDim calls
- get acquisition from ts when creating a tomo
- fix pixsize and dims for etomo outputs (closes #139)
- fix beadtrack args to match copytomocoms script
- always use antialias when binning a stack
- two surfaces search is off in both protocols for consistency
- bead radius default is 18px (good range for bin 4 and 10nm beads)
- use sobel filter for bead centering for most cryo data
- use lowpass for bead tracking
- use adjustbeadsizes
- trimvol -yz replaced by -rx, the first one flips the hand
- add expandcircles to eraser
- replace wrong dose file format for mtffilter
- set output 3D coord size based on bead diameter
- fix betterradius param in gold eraser tab of the fid alignment
- add missing pix size in fid align
- fix minpacing in gold picker
